# Nature of Code Python Work

This repository represents a living document of my working through The Nature of Code by Daniel Shiffman. However, rather than completing the work in processing as done in the text, I've chosen to rework things into Python as best as I am able to. The code in this repository is not intended to represent the original work found in The Nature of Code to its original quality but is simpply snapshots of my hacked together Python solutions.
